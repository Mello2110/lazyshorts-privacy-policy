                            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                            as of the date such litigation is filed.

                            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                            meet the following conditions:

                            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
                            Works a copy of this License; and

                            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                            stating that You changed the files; and

                            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                            the Derivative Works; and

                            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file, You must include a
                            readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
                            NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                            any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
                            following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                            as modifying the License.

                            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                            the conditions stated in this License.

                            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work on an "AS IS"
                            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
                            or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
                            conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
                            FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
                            the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
                            any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
                            License.

                            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                            shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
                            direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
                            of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
                            use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
                            damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
                            malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses),
                            even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
                            such damages.

                            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                            or other liability obligations consistent with this License.
                            However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
                            own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
                            other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
                            and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
                            or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
                            accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                            1. Preamble

                            This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between Mellow Solutions
                            ("Licensor") and the entity or individual ("Licensee") purchasing rights to use the
                            LazyShorts Chrome Extension ("Software") for commercial purposes that exceed the scope of
                            the Apache License 2.0.

                            By purchasing or obtaining this Commercial License, you agree to be bound by the terms
                            herein.

                            2. Grant of License

                            Subject to the payment of applicable fees and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor
                            grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to:

                            1. Use the Software in a commercial environment.
                            2. Integrate the Software into proprietary products or services.
                            3. Modify the Software for internal business use without the obligation to release source
                            code changes (unlike the open-source requirements).
                            4. Distribute the Software as part of a commercial offering, subject to the royalty terms
                            below.

                            3. Commercial Use Definition

                            "Commercial Use" includes, but is not limited to:
                            * Using the Software to provide a paid service to third parties.
                            * Bundling the Software with a paid product.
                            * Using the Software in an internal workflow that directly generates revenue exceeding the
                            threshold defined in Section 4.

                            4. Fees and Royalties

                            4.1 Revenue Threshold and Fee
                            Licensee agrees to pay Licensor a royalty fee if the gross revenue generated by the product
                            or service utilizing the Software exceeds €10,000.00 (Ten Thousand Euros) per calendar year.

                            * Fee Amount: 1% of total gross revenue generated by the product/service using the Software.
                            * Payment Schedule: Payments are due annually, no later than 30 days after the end of the
                            Licensee's fiscal year.

                            4.2 Reporting
                            Licensee shall provide a simplified annual report stating the gross revenue subject to
                            royalties. Licensor reserves the right to audit these records with reasonable notice (once
                            per year).

                            5. Restrictions

                            1. No Resale of License: You may not sublicense, sell, or lease this License itself to
                            others.
                            2. Proprietary Distribution: While you may distribute the Software as part of your product,
                            you may not simply re-package the Software "as-is" and sell it as a standalone product
                            competing directly with LazyShorts.
                            3. Attribution: You must retain the copyright notice "Copyright © 2026 Mellow Solutions" in
                            the documentation or "About" section of your product.

                            6. Support and Warranty

                            * Since this is a commercial agreement, Licensor provides Priority Email Support for
                            Licensees with an active agreement.
                            * Disclaimer: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT
                            WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

                            7. Term and Termination

                            * This Agreement is effective upon payment of the initial license fee (if any) or upon
                            commencement of Commercial Use.
                            * Licensor may terminate this Agreement if Licensee breaches any material term (e.g.,
                            non-payment of royalties) and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of notice.
